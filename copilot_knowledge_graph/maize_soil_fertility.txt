Soil fertility management
Soil fertility can be managed through several strategies including, organic fertilizers/manures, and inorganic or chemical fertilizers.
Organic fertilizers/manures Farmyard manure (FYM) can be applied either alone at a rate of 4 tonnes per acre. When FYM is used in combination with inorganic fertilizers half the recommended rates should be applied.
Inorganic/chemical fertilizers Fertilizer recommendations are based on different agro-ecological zones and soil types. The main fertilizers used are Di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) at 50kg/acre (50kg bag/acre) (applied at planting), Calcium ammonium phosphate (CAN) at 92kg/acre (2 bags of 50kg each) topdressed when the plants are knee-high. However, farmers should follow the recommendations agreed during the KCEP validation workshop until further notice.
Management of acid soils Liming is recommended for acidic soils. However, other fertilizers with a liming effect like MEA Mazao (100kg/acre), Mavuno basal (100 kg/acre) and Mavuno for topdressing (75 kg/acre) are recommended for acidic soils.
