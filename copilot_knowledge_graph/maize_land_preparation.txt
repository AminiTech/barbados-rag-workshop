Maize Land preparation
A maize farm can be prepared using either conventional or Conservation Agriculture (CA) methods. Conservation Agriculture, includes spraying with recommended herbicides and crop residue management. Conventional methods include hand cultivation, use of an ox-plough or a tractor (figure 1). It is important to prepare the land early enough to allow weeds to dry and decompose before planting.
